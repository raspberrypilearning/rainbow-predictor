## Predicting a rainbow

Rainbows happen when the sun shines through water droplets at the right angle (usually in the afternoon.) If it's warm and the humidity is high then it's worth checking to see if there's a rainbow.

+ Now let's only show the rainbow if the conditions are right. Change your code to look like this:

    You can't be sure there's a rainbow when these conditions are met, but it's worth a look.

+ Try changing the values on the slider until you see the rainbow.

    Remember that the values reported won't be exactly the same as those shown on the sliders.

+ A *threshold* is a number that indicates an important change. 20 degrees C and 80% humidity are thresholds for the rainbow detector.
    
    Try changing the thresholds and then moving the sliders to trigger a rainbow.
    
    If you're working with a physical Sense HAT then you can test your code by setting the thresholds to low values.
