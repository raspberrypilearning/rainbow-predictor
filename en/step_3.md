## Reading the sensor data

The Sense HAT has a range of sensors that provide real world data on a Raspberry Pi computer. The Sense HAT Emulator in Trinket allows you write and test projects for the Sense HAT in your web browser. 

The humidity sensor reports the amount of moisture in the air. Humidity is high when it rains. 

+ Let's read from the humidity sensor and print out the result. Add the highlighted code to the bottom of your script.

+ Test your program by moving the humidity slider to different values.

   Notice that the value you get back from the humidity sensor isn't exactly the same as the value on the slider. This is because the sensors aren't perfectly accurate.
