## Introduction:

In this project you will use the temperature and humidity sensors on the Sense HAT to predict when there’s a good chance of spotting a rainbow. When the right conditions are detected you will display a rainbow on the Sense HAT LED Matrix.

In the Trinket emulator you can move the sliders to change the temperature and humidity, they look like this:

You'll get a rainbow if the temperature is over 20 degrees C and the humidity is over 80 percent. Try experimenting to find the weather conditions for sunshine (yellow) and snow (white).

## Introduction:

In this project, children will learn how to use the Sense HAT sensors to detect the weather, and display a rainbow using the LED matrix when it's warm and humid.

## Online Resources

**This project uses Python 3.** We recommend using [Trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write Python online. This project contains the following Trinkets:

* ['Rainbow Predictor' Starter Trinket -- jumpto.cc/rainbow-go](http://jumpto.cc/rainbow-go)

There is also a trinket containing the completed project:

* [‘Rainbow Predictor’ Finished -- trinket.io/python/eaea4cb76c](https://trinket.io/python/eaea4cb76c)

## Offline Resources

This project can also be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/physical-sense-hat/) on a Raspberry Pi computer with a Sense HAT. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

* rainbow/rainbow.py

You can also find a completed version of this project in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

* rainbow-finished/rainbow.py

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)

## Learning Objectives

* Physical computing - sensors;
* Boolean AND; 
* RGB Colours;
* Sense HAT display;

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

* [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)

## Challenges

* More Weather - display different images under different weather conditions.
